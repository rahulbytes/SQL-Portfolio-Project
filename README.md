## Introduction

The SQL Sales Data Analysis Project demonstrates the process of analyzing sales data to gain valuable insights. By leveraging SQL queries, this project aims to provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis.

## Data Analysis

Sales data analysis is crucial for understanding business performance and identifying growth opportunities. In this project, we dive into various aspects, including:
- Sales trends
- Product performance
- Customer behavior
- Advanced calculations

## SQL Queries

SQL queries are the backbone of this analysis. We use SQL to extract, transform, and analyze the sales dataset. Key aspects of the SQL analysis include:
- Data extraction
- Aggregation and grouping
- Joins and subqueries
- Common Table Expressions (CTE)
- Calculations and functions
